		<title>GA Rush of Incomplete Works by Enoch Oh Shin</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Enoch's incomplete works of GA projects </h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Project 1: I have no memory or any slight recollection</li>	
				<li>Project 2: same as project 1</li>	
				<li>Project 3: group project, learned disappointment and grou ego management</li>	
				<li>Project 4: almost but not quite done project.  Ruby MVC heavy</li>	
			</ul>
		<p>Bio: I love fixing problems and I do this daily at NTT COM security, the security branch for NTT COM, the largest telecomm provider in the world.  I am currently a Security Engineer Team Lead but I would not mind changing my title for Junior Developer.  I think creatively is one of the most valuable assets we have and I would love to create apps that I can call my own, thus my GA membership.</p>

		<p>I don't do social media because I have no friends and its embarrassing to have a social media account with no friends listed when you eventually are asked to share it.</p>

		<p>I love to play pranks at work but I am also known to get things done because I value hard work since I have seen my parents work very hard for very little and I have worked since I was a kid.</p>
